## FAQ

**Works on my device?**
  - Yes, it works on all Android 7.0+ devices, but is optimized for newer Snapdragon and MediaTek chipsets.

**Will this break my device?**
  - This is completely impossible, if you feel that your phone is overheating too quickly without being in performance or gaming mode, restart it and it will be resolved.

**Can my cell phone go into loop?**
  - Another almost impossible scenario, as all scripts are tested on a significant number of devices.

**Does this support my kernel?**
  - You can rest assured about that, but there are some scripts that only support kernel 5.0+, so it won't cause you any problems.

 - Ensure the download link in your video description is the official pling link.

## Requirements 

 - Nightshade only works on devices running Android 7.0 or higher, keep that in mind.

## Installation

* Download [here](https://github.com/haxislancelot/Nightshade/releases).
- Before starting the app, grant superuser permission. If you're using Magisk, it will prompt for permission upon opening, just confirm.
- The first time you launch the app, ensure you have internet access as scripts and configurations will be downloaded automatically. After this setup, internet access is not required for subsequent openings, but it will keep you updated if available.
- Every time your device restarts, open the app to activate your preferred mode. It always remembers the last mode used and applies it upon opening. This process typically takes three to seven seconds.
