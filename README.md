## FAQ

**Works on my device?**
  - Yes, it works on all Android 7.0+ devices, but is optimized for newer Snapdragon and MediaTek chipsets.

**Will this break my device?**
  - This is completely impossible, if you feel that your phone is overheating too quickly without being in performance or gaming mode, restart it and it will be resolved.

**Can my cell phone go into loop?**
  - Another almost impossible scenario, as all scripts are tested on a significant number of devices.

**Does this support my kernel?**
  - You can rest assured about that, but there are some scripts that only support kernel 5.0+, so it won't cause you any problems.
